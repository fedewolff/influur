# Business Analyst CHALLENGE: 

The repository es public so everyone at Influrr and Neuraldesign have access to the files.

The Dashboard is in PDF format, but also you can find the original Link in the "Test_Answer" PDF every other answer.

There are two Python scripts, one is ".py" and the other one ".ipynb".

If you have any question, feel free to send me an email to fede.wolff1@gmail.com
